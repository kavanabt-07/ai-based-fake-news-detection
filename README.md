# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify news headlines as **FAKE** or **REAL**. It preprocesses text, converts it into numerical features using TF-IDF, and trains a Passive Aggressive Classifier to make predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* NLTK
* Scikit-learn
* TF-IDF Vectorization
* Passive Aggressive Classifier

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Creates a sample dataset of real and fake news headlines.
2. Cleans text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, removing stop words, and applying stemming.
3. Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Converts text into TF-IDF features.
5. Trains and evaluates the machine learning model.
6. Predicts whether custom news headlines are FAKE or REAL.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn
python fake_news_detection.py
```

## ⚠️ Note

This project uses a small sample dataset for demonstration. Predictions are not reliable fact-checks, and accuracy on this dataset does not establish real-world performance.

## 🎯 Future Improvements

* Use a larger, real-world news dataset.
* Improve model accuracy through testing and tuning.
* Build a web interface for interactive predictions.
